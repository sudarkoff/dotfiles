## Installation

Copy and paste into your terminal:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/sudarkoff/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```

Initially based on [skwp/dotfiles](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) and modified and extended with ideas borrowed from other people's dotfiles projects listed on [dotfiles.github.io](http://dotfiles.github.io/). Another projects I borrowed a lot from is [cowboy/dotfiles](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles)
